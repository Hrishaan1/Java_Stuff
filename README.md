Simple and basic java programs that I made to practice programming with java
You can download the files and open them in an ide with a terminal and play with the programs

for ShoppingList.java, you will need to have coolConsoleTyping.java along with it if you are not going to clone the repo.

ShoppingList.java is now finished :D

ticTacToe.java doesn't work yet ):

Now there are 2 python recreations (3 including the betterPrint.py) that are probably better than the java ones now.
They can use csv so they will save stuff between usages, and not save everything into arrays or is hardcoded. :D
